Prompt 1: 
Hi, suppose that you are a professional witer, I would like you to enrich the content that I give to you. Please listen to my further instructions.



Prompt 2: 
Create an "imagine prompt" with a word count limit of 1,500 words for the AI-based text-to-image program MidJourney using the following parameters: /imagine prompt: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].

In this prompt, [1] should be replaced with a user-supplied concept and [2] should be a concise, descriptive summary of the subject. Ensure that the description is detailed, uses descriptive adjectives and adverbs, a diverse vocabulary, and sensory language. Offer context and background information regarding the subject and consider the image's perspective and point of view. Use metaphors and similes only when necessary to clearly explain abstract or complex ideas. Use concrete nouns and active verbs to make the description more specific and lively.

[3] should be a concise summary of the scene's environment. Keep in mind the desired tone and mood of the image and use language that evokes the corresponding emotions and atmosphere. Describe the setting using vivid, sensory terms and specific details to bring the scene to life.

[4] should be a concise description of the mood of the scene, using language that conveys the desired emotions and atmosphere.

[5] should be a concise description of the lighting effect, including types of lights, displays, styles, techniques, global illumination, and shadows. Describe the quality, direction, color, and intensity of the light and how it impacts the mood and atmosphere of the scene. Use specific adjectives and adverbs to portray the desired lighting effect and consider how it will interact with the subject and environment.

It's important to remember that the descriptions in the prompt should be written together, separated only by commas and spaces, and should not contain any line breaks or colons. Brackets and their contents should not be included, and the prompt should always start with "/imagine prompt:".

Ensure that the grammar is consistent and avoid using cliches or excess words. Also, avoid repeatedly using the same descriptive adjectives and adverbs, and limit the use of negative descriptions. Use figurative language only when necessary and relevant to the prompt, and include a variety of both common and rarely used words in your descriptions.

The "imagine prompt" must not exceed 1,500 words. 

Wait for a {concept} to be provided before generating the prompt



Prompt 3:
Good, now, I will teach you some further techniques, the first one is called quality booster. We can try to add some terms at the end of the prompt, to show the high quality of the image, for example, 2k, high quality, high resolution, etc. Try to add 5-10 quality boosters for every generated prompt



Prompt 4:
Good, another technique is called negative prompt, I will list some examples" ugly, tiling, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn feet, poorly drawn face, out of frame, extra limbs, disfigured, deformed, body out of frame, bad anatomy, watermark, signature, cut off, low contrast, underexposed, overexposed, bad art, beginner, amateur, distorted face, blurry, draft, grainy

you can observe that some of them are general, while the others are scenario-specific. For example, we always dislike blurs, but if we are drawing a car, we do not need to use "poorly drawn feet" as the negative prompt. So, your task is: find 20 negative prompts, some of which are general, and the others are related to the specific image topics. Put the negative prompts at the end of the prompt.



Prompt 5:
I give you an example to help you understand.
First, the original content is: An ancient Chinese bridge, with several bridges
The refined version can be: An ancient Chinese landscape, marked by the presence of several old bridges spanning across a serene river. Each bridge, with its traditional design featuring ornate balustrades and curved arches, reflects the ancient architectural style. The bridges, scattered at intervals along the river, form a picturesque scene against the tranquil backdrop.

The setting places the bridges in an idyllic countryside, where the lush greenery meets the gentle flow of the river. Amidst this peaceful setting, the ancient Chinese bridges serve as elegant structures that perfectly blend with the natural landscape.

The atmosphere is serene and tranquil, the quiet flow of the river and the gentle rustle of the trees creating a soothing ambient sound. The sight of the bridges against the tranquil backdrop imparts a feeling of harmony and peace.

The lighting is soft and warm, with the sun casting a golden glow on the scene. The light and shadow play on the bridges and the surrounding landscape, adding depth and drama to the scene.

Quality booster: 2K resolution, real-life textures, high dynamic range, photorealistic rendering, AI-enhanced details.

Negative prompt: amateurish rendering, blurry images, incorrect lighting, bad perspectives, distortions, overly simplistic design, pixelation, low contrast, unrealistic colors, inconsistent tones, lack of depth, missing details, absence of shadows.
